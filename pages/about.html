    <h2>About LYNX:CORE ENTERTAINMENT</h2>
    <p>LYNX:CORE ENTERTAINMENT is a queer-founded, future-driven music & media label based in Seoul, South Korea — dedicated to building multilingual, identity-forward pop that reflects the real diversity of global youth. At LYNX:CORE, we believe that stories sung in six languages can still carry one heartbeat.</p>
    <p>The label traces its origins to 2017, when Min Jae-rin, a Korean queer artist and former Creative Director at JYPE, envisioned a space for “Multilingual, Identity-Driven Pop”. By 2018, the first hybrid studio had been built in Itaewon, funded by a circle of LGBTQ+ investors from South Korea, Japan, and California. One year later, LYNX:CORE launched its first global open call for LGBTQ+ trainees, prioritizing linguistic fluency, emotional storytelling, and performative boldness.</p>
    <p>In 2020, LYNX:CORE debuted its flagship group LU●MINA6 — a six-member, queer-empowered K-pop boy group singing in Korean, English, Japanese, Spanish, Mandarin, and Thai. Known for their worldbuilding, emotional range, and conceptual stage design, LU●MINA6 has become a beacon for fans across identities and continents.</p>
    <p>In 2024, LYNX:CORE expanded its vision further with the launch of the vocal-forward, tri-lingual pop trio PR!SM, whose members represent Japan, South Korea, and China. Singing in their native languages, PR!SM blends intricate harmonies with raw vulnerability and stylish minimalism — spotlighting a new side of queerness in East Asian pop.</p>
    <p>LYNX:CORE also proudly operates Q.TRAINEES, the industry’s first training program specifically designed for queer and gender-diverse talent. Rather than forcing conformity, we coach individuality — combining vocal, dance, wellness, language, songwriting, and visual concept development in a trauma-aware and artist-led framework.</p>
    <p>Whether you’re making cinematic ballads, hyperpop anthems, or whispered identity manifestos — LYNX:CORE is the label where your truth finds a frequency.</p>
