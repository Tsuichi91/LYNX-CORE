      <p>Trainees receive top-tier training in vocals, dance, stagecraft, songwriting, performance art, and cross-cultural communication — all tailored to amplify their personal voice and story. Sessions are led by queer-affirming mentors and industry experts from Korea, Japan, Europe, and beyond.</p>
      <p>But Q.TRAINEES is more than just a training program — it’s a movement. Trainees enter under transparent, ethical contracts, with built-in support for mental health, creative freedom, and artistic ownership.</p>
      <p>The result? Artists who aren’t just ready to debut — but ready to change the industry from within.</p>
      <p>From multilingual vocals and experimental concepts to narratives rooted in queerness, diaspora, and self-love, Q.TRAINEES is shaping the future of global pop — one fearless voice at a time.</p>
